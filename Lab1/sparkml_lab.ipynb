    "2. `latitude`: a measure of how far north a house is (a higher value is farther north)\n",
    "3. `housing_,median_age`: median age of a house within a block (a lower number is a newer building)\n",

    "One of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature scaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don't perform well when the input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the housing data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median incomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the label attribues is generally not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get all attributes to have the same scale is to use standardization. In standardization, for each value, first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. To do this, we can use the `StandardScaler` Estimator. To use `StandardScaler`, again we need to convert all the numerical attributes into a big vectore of features using `VectorAssembler`, and then call `StandardScaler` on that vactor."

    "# 6. Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "An important task in Machie Learning is model selection, or using data to find the best model or parameters for a given task. This is also called tuning. Tuning may be done for individual Estimators such as LinearRegression, or for entire Pipelines which include multiple algorithms, featurization, and other steps. Users can tune an entire Pipeline at once, rather than tuning each element in the Pipeline separately. MLlib supports model selection tools, such as `CrossValidator`. These tools require the following items:\n",
    "* Estimator: algorithm or Pipeline to tune (`setEstimator`)\n",
    "* Set of ParamMaps: parameters to choose from, sometimes called a \"parameter grid\" to search over (`setEstimatorParamMaps`)\n",
    "* Evaluator: metric to measure how well a fitted Model does on held-out test data (`setEvaluator`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`CrossValidator` begins by splitting the dataset into a set of folds, which are used as separate training and test datasets. For example with `k=3` folds, `CrossValidator` will generate 3 (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 2/3 of the data for training and 1/3 for testing. To evaluate a particular `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` computes the average evaluation metric for the 3 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 3 different (training, test) dataset pairs. After identifying the best `ParamMap`, `CrossValidator` finally re-fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, use the `CrossValidator` to select the best Random Forest model. To do so, you need to define a grid of parameters. Let's say we want to do the search among the different number of trees (1, 5, and 10), and different tree depth (5, 10, and 15)."

In standardization, for each value, first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. To do this, we use the `StandardScaler` Estimator. To use `StandardScaler`, we need to convert all the numerical attributes into a big vectore of features using `VectorAssembler`, and then call `StandardScaler` on that vector."
